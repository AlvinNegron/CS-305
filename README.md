Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for thei customers. They want to modernize their operations by increasing their security to protect themseleves from outside threats. They wanted us to identify any vulnerabilities. When I found our clients software security vulnerabilities, I created a document to document my findings. It is very important to code securely because it will help us create a more secure application for our client. Having a well secure application will add a tremendous amount of overall wellbeing to a company. 

Throughout the course I ran into alot of difficutlies, some I managed to get through but others were just impossible to fix. This was in part that most of the files that were given to us were broken. To increase our clients security we implemented a cryptographic hash and also used a Maven Dependency Check to check for vulnerabilities. To make sure that the code and software aplication was secure we used a Maven Dependency Check, once we found our vulnerabilities we refactored our code and checked again. This maven tool could be very useful with other applications in terms of the security. For my future employers I will probably show them the Maven part, to show that I have knowledge on checking for security vulnerabilties.
